# Extra dependency declarations for projects built by KDE Linux.
#
# kde-builder resolves dependencies from sysadmin/repo-metadata, but that
# repository is maintained by KDE and cannot easily be patched in this
# pipeline. The kde-builder YAML configuration (extra-projects.yaml) only
# supports build options (cmake-options, branch, etc.) — it has no mechanism
# for declaring inter-project dependencies.
#
# This file fills that gap. Each key is a project name, and its value is a
# list of additional projects it depends on. These are merged into the
# dependency list that kde-builder provides via `--query project-info`.
